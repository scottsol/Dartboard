## Synopsis

This Repository is dedicated to making an electronic dartboard compatible with popular low end hardware (most notably, the Raspberry Pi)

## Code Example

Coming Soon

## Motivation

Ever since I was a kid, my family has played darts as a popular pass-time.  Recently, I came across an old bar-sized electronic dartboard.  Unfortunately, the electronic scoring system no longer functions.  The memory chip that the board used to store its software has failed, and I have been unable to find the software online, so it cannot be repaired.  So I figured why not make my own?

## Installation

Install Python 3 as well as Pygame.  From the command line run main.py.  Instructions on how to use the code for more specific board configurations coming soon.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Coming Soon

## Contributors

Contribution is welcome.  Feel free to message me if you wish to help.
